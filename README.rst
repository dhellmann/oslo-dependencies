=======================
 Oslo Dependency Graph
=======================

This repository contains some tools for working out the dependencies
between various libraries, being managed under the OpenStack Oslo
program.

The status.txt document comes from (and should be synced with)
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Oslo/GraduationStatus

The graphing tools rely on having the graphviz toolkit from
http://www.graphviz.org/Documentation.php installed.

Run ``./make_image.sh`` and revel in the pretty PNGs.
